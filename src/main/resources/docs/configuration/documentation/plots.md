# Configuration Documentation: plots

The "plots" section of a Watchr config file is the most important part of your configuration.  This is where you can specify the types of plots that Watchr will produce (see the "plot" child element), the instructions for parsing data files to produce data for these plots (see the "files" child element), and the categories that the plots will belong to (see the "categories" child element).
