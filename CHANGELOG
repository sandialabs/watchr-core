WATCHR-CORE
Release Notes

1.0.0 (2021-04-21)
-----------
The first release of watchr-core represents a major refactoring of the previous iteration of Watchr, which was simply
a Jenkins plugin that performed all of Watchr's functionality by itself.  Now, watchr-core represents all of the
non-Jenkins functionality that Watchr represents - scraping temporal data from many report files, storing it, and
generating graphs.

There have been many exciting features added to watchr-core as a result of this splitting away from Jenkins:
- All Watchr graphs are now defined by a single configuration file, which throws the door wide open for more sophisticated
graph organization failure condition checking, and more.  These types of configuration changes are now completely up to
the user, and donâ€™t have to be logged as formal feature requests.
- Watchr can now scrape data arbitrarily from any XML or JSON file.
- We've migrated to the more flexible plotly.js as the graphing library of choice, which means graphs look nicer and we can
support more than just line charts.
- All previous features we worked on circa 2019 (custom plots and data filtering) are still available.
- Finally, being separated into a non-Jenkins library means that we can apply Watchr-style functionality to other
endpoints apart from Jenkins (such as CDash, or even just standalone plot rendering).
